Deep Learning is a new area of Machine Learning research.
which has been introduced with the objective of moving Machine Learning closer to one of its original goals.
Deep architectures are composed of multiple levels of non-linear operations.
such as in neural nets with many hidden layers or in complicated propositional formulae re-using many sub-formulae.
Searching the parameter space of deep architectures is a difficult task.
but learning algorithms such as those for Deep Belief Networks have recently been proposed to tackle this problem
